## Why I Made This Project
I created this CyberQuiz game for non-technical users so they can learn basic cybersecurity concepts in a fun and interactive way. Instead of reading long notes or attending boring lectures, this quiz gives them an easy, gamified method to understand important security practices. My goal was to make cybersecurity feel simple, enjoyable, and accessible for everyone. This project also supports my goal of becoming an AI Security Engineer by strengthening my fundamentals.
